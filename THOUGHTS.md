I always want to find something small and quick. I never want to find a whole
tutorial that I wrote. I want to know something, and know it quick. I've learnt
it once, all I need is a reminder.

Therefore information should be stored on cards. Each card has a title, and the
information as well as tags. Why should it be hierarchical? How should the tags
work?

If I wanted to find something on ssh jumphosts I would type: "ssh jump host 
setup" and the cards with tags matching majority of these things would show
first, followed by the least amount.

Then I should be able to put these cards together and create a view. These views
will be able to be shared and also looked up in a separate way. Views should be
able to be made in less than a minute, and cards should have a link to other
cards that seem related, this 'seem' part comes from an algorithm that will
detect whether two cards have similar information. This functionality will be
exposed to the user to easily create views.

The general design below therefore has changed. Instead of a file view, it will
be a tag view. Why should I be looking for /home/scott/code/project/folder/folderB/foo/bar
when I could just have that folder tagged as "project foo bar". Would this work
for all information? Should I list all the information and then decide the best
way to organise it?
